title: "Erasmus Student Network (ESN)"

For many years I have worked in my free time as volunteer for the [Erasmus Student Network](http://esn.org//). ESN was founded on 1989 and it is the **biggest student association in Europe**, present in more than 480 Higher Education Institutions from 37 countries. ESN aims at supportung and developing **student exchange** and **international mobility**. 



### About the Erasmus Student Network

ESN aims at working in the interest of students who are spending a part of their professional education at a higher education institution in a country other than the one in which their home institution is situated. The organisation works to **improve the conditions for present and future exchange students** and to promote the exchange experience and concerns itself directly or indirectly with every aspect of this subject as broadly as possible. It does so without being associated with any political or confessional group.Through its work for the mobile students, ESN also aims at working for the non-mobile students by **improving their chances to experience international student exchange at their home institution**. 



### ESNsurvey

One of the projects I have worked on is the ESNsurvey. It is the biggest regular European research project **planned and carried out entirely by students for students**. It is conducted annually since 2005 and surveys students at higher education institutions. ESN shares the results with the main stakeholders in higher education and mobility programmes. 

The **aims of the ESNsurvey** are:

- Explore current issues connected to academic and non-academic mobility and education.
- Get a better insight into student issues in order to represent their real needs.

I co-authored two editions: 

* [ESNsurvey 2018](https://esn.org/esnsurvey/2018) on the Challenges and Enablers of International Mobility for Students with Disabilities
* [ESNsurvey 2016](https://esn.org/esnsurvey/2016) on the International-Friendliness of Universities



### International Education and Advocacy

The Erasmus Student Network actively contributes to the European Union policies by publishing **policy papers** in the fields of **education and training** as well as **youth and voluntering.** The advocacy done by ESN regarding the **general improvement of exchange programmes in Europe** is based on the opinions of more than 180.000 exchange students that we assist every year and whose opinion os collected in **surveys** and **researches**. Here there is a sample of the [position papers](http://esn.org/position-papers) released by ESN:

- [Erasmus+ 1st Year Review](../../../../../../esn.org/sites/default/files/news/Erasmus%2b - 1st Year Review.pdf) by the European University Foundation and the Erasmus Student Network.
