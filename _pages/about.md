Welcome to my personal page! 

I am a postdoctoral researcher in Mathematics at the [Institute of Mathematics](https://www.math.tu-berlin.de/menue/home/parameter/en/) of the [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/) in Germany. I work with [Prof. Yuri Suris](http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~suris/) in the [Geometry and Mathematical Physics](https://www.math.tu-berlin.de/arbeitsgruppen/ag_geometrie_und_mathematische_physik/geometrie_und_mathematische_physik/parameter/en/) group and I am also part of the [SFB Discretisation in Geometry and Dynamics (Transregio 109)](https://www.discretization.de/) programme of the German Research Foundation (DFG). My research lies in the area of **dynamical systems** and **integrability** and currently focuses on the birational dynamics appearing from the **Kahan discretisation** of integrable systems. I combine the theory of dynamical systems and algebraic geometry with numerical experiments and the use of mathematical software, mostly Mathematica. 

Before that, I was at the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/departments/mathematics/) of the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/) in Belgium, where I obtained my PhD and I still collaborate as a volunteer. I worked with [Prof. Sonja Hohloch](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/sonja-hohloch/) and [Prof. Holger Dullin](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/dullin/) from the University of Sydney in the symplectic classification of **semitoric systems**, a class of integrable systems with two degrees of freedom. In particular, we found ways to compute the **symplectic invariants** using the theory of elliptic integrals and symplectic geometry. 

This semester I am responsible for the exercise sessions of *Mathematik für PhysikerInnen II.* Before that, I have also been teaching the exercise sessions of different BSc and MSc courses for mathematics and physics students both in Berlin and in Antwerp.

### My main research interests:

* Discretisation of integrable systems
* Integrability of birational discrete dynamical systems
* Semitoric integrable systems and their classification
* Symplectic invariants of singular Lagrangian fibrations
* Geometric aspects of dynamical systems
* Bifurcation of ordinary differential equations

Besides that, I am also generally interested in data-driven modelling, time-series analysis, machine learning, complex systems and in models with differential equations in physics, chemistry and social sciences.
