I am a postdoctoral researcher in Mathematics and my passion is to understand how things change with time. My research lies in the area of **dynamical systems** and **integrability** and focuses on two topics: the birational dynamics that appear from the **Kahan discretisation** of integrable systems and the symplectic classification of **semitoric systems**. In  particular, I like to study the geometric aspects of dynamics, so I use ideas from **algebraic geometry** and **symplectic geometry** for my research, as well as mathematical software, such as Mathematica. 

Affiliations: 

* I am a member of the [Geometry and Mathematical Physics](https://www.math.tu-berlin.de/arbeitsgruppen/ag_geometrie_und_mathematische_physik/geometrie_und_mathematische_physik/parameter/en/) group of the Technical University of Berlin, under the mentoring of [Prof. Yuri Suris](http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~suris/). 
* I am also part of the [SFB Discretisation in Geometry and Dynamics (Transregio 109)](https://www.discretization.de/) programme of the German Research Foundation (DFG).
* I collaborate as a volunteer with the [Fundamental Mathematics](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/fundamental-mathematics/) group of the University of Antwerp.

This semester I am also responsible for the exercise sessions of *Mathematik f√ºr PhysikerInnen II.*
